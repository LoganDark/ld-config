# LD Config
LD Config provides a couple helper classes that make creating Cloth config screens (that properly save to and load from config files) easier.

Features:
- Custom de/serialization
- Categories and stuff
- Data fixers and config versioning
- Pretty printed config file (it's still JSON though)
- It's super easy and quick to use

Check out the GitHub wiki for more information.
